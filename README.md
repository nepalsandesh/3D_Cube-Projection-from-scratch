# 3D_Cube-Projection-from-scratch
3D cube projection in 2D window 

libraries Used::
    Pygame
    numpy
    math
    random  # this module is used here to randomly change the screen background color.

The vertices of cube is multiplied with projection_matrix to get 2D coordinate.
The Rotation is done by multiplying the points with Rotation_matrix
